## Current Project.
# web-chat
- A full-fledged lightweight chatting website [web-chat](https://web-chat.onrender.com) 
- Integrated with [web-sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for live updates of users.
- It is a discord clone where you can create/add a new server.*Basically databases
- You can send, react and reply messages (super efficient)
- web-chat never saves your data it just take a file update it when you use web-chat and then it is available for you to download/save to yourside.
- Multiple Servers can coexist without any interference.
- You can chose which server you wanna join (at registration).
- No choise would be needed at login. It automatically tracks your account and give you access to all registered accounts
- You can share media files too and forward them without increasing storage

## Stack Used:

- Programming Language : Python
- Frame Work : Flask 
- Database : Postgress and sqlite3
- Server for Web-sockets : gunicorn gevent
- Frontend : Basic HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Future Ideas.
- Update Fecth API with XHR
- use local storage to store chats for quick responses.
- Add a feature to create a profile to every Channel, User. Just an md file like github.
- Add better streaming system for media files
